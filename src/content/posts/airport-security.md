The TSA agent held up my carry-on bag, which contained what I thought was a perfectly reasonable art installation: three rubber ducks, a vintage toaster, and a copy of Richard Nixon's autobiography connected by yarn. "Sir," she said with the weary tone of someone who's seen everything but still manages to be surprised, "what exactly is this?"

"It's art," I explained, as if that would clarify everything. "The ducks represent capitalism, the toaster is a metaphor for political burnout, and the yarn... well, the yarn ties it all together." She looked at me the way my father used to when I told him I wanted to be a writer.

Behind me, a businessman in an expensive suit cleared his throat loudly, as if to say, "Some of us have planes to catch and don't have time for this postmodern nonsense."
