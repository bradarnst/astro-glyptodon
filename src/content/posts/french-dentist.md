I've always believed that the true measure of a country's civilization isn't its art museums or opera houses, but rather its dental practices. In Paris, this theory was put to the test when I found myself in the chair of Dr. Laurent, a man whose commitment to causing discomfort rivaled that of medieval torturers.

"Zees will only hurt a leetle," he said, brandishing what appeared to be a repurposed car jack. I noticed his diploma was written in crayon, but by then it was too late to run.

The waiting room had been my first clue. Instead of the usual magazines, there were only copies of Victor Hugo's Les Mis√©rables, presumably to remind patients that things could always be worse. A fish tank contained what I'm certain was a piranha, though the receptionist insisted it was a "friendly goldfish with an attitude."
