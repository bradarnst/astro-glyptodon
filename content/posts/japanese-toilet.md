The toilet in my Tokyo hotel room had more buttons than a space shuttle. There was a control panel on the side with symbols that looked like hieroglyphics designed by a committee of drunk robots. One button had what appeared to be a musical note being struck by lightning â€“ was this for emergency karaoke situations?

My sister Amy would have just pressed every button until something happened, but I took the scholarly approach and pulled out Google Translate. Unfortunately, the app translated "gentle cleansing spray" as "water dragon awakening ceremony," which really didn't help my anxiety.

The breaking point came when I accidentally pressed what I thought was the flush button, only to be serenaded by bird sounds while warm air blasted from unexpected directions. Somewhere in the great beyond, my father was laughing.
