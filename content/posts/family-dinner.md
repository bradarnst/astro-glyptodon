My mother approached Thanksgiving dinner the way some people approach defusing bombs: with a mixture of precision, terror, and the persistent feeling that everything could explode at any moment. The turkey was less a meal than a yearly referendum on our family's stability.

"The secret," she would say, consulting a recipe card that had been handled so many times it resembled ancient papyrus, "is to treat the bird like it's plotting against you." This explained why she would sometimes stand in the kitchen at 3 AM, staring suspiciously at the refrigerator.

My sister Lisa once suggested we try tofurkey instead. Mom responded by clutching her pearls so hard they nearly turned to diamonds. Dad, ever the diplomat, suggested we have both, not realizing he had just doubled the potential for disaster.
