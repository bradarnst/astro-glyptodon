The problem with learning German is that one wrong syllable can transform you from a polite tourist into someone accidentally declaring war on Switzerland. My language teacher, Frau Schmidt, had the patience of a saint and the expression of someone watching a car crash in slow motion.

"Ich bin ein Hubschrauber," I announced proudly to the class, thinking I was saying "I am helpful." Instead, I had declared myself to be a helicopter. Frau Schmidt's eye began to twitch when I then attempted to conjugate myself into the past tense, essentially telling the class I was a helicopter who was expecting twins.

The other students, mostly young professionals hoping to work in Berlin, maintained straight faces with the kind of discipline that would impress a Royal Guard. Only Klaus, an elderly man taking the class "to keep his mind sharp," would occasionally snort into his coffee when I spoke.
